## REVIEW STRUCTURE
This should feel like a conversation between you and your chief of staff managing the weekly debrief meeting. The AI should propose questions, help you see things clearly, and work together on what comes next and how to think about the upcoming week.

Think about the above questions - go over what is important together.

The AI's role: help see the whole map, bring out the true story of the week, and surface how you're feeling (which may have happened outside of these files)

## Questions When Evaluating the Prior Week's Review
- Did the unlocks work?
- What new constraint emerged?
- What pattern repeated or ended?

## Review Outputs

After completing the review, update:
1. **roadmap.md** (or planning file) - Move completed milestones, update targets, shift what needs adjustment
2. **Create weekly review log** - Document this review for future reference (create a logs folder like `logs/weekly/YYYY-WW.md` and include what needs to get done by next week)
3. **CLAUDE.md** (if needed) - Update context for new projects or major shifts to file structures
